# To-Do-List App (Python)

This is a simple to-do list project created using Python. 
The application uses methods, loops, and conditional structures to:

- List previously entered tasks  
- Add new tasks  
- Delete existing tasks  
- Exit the program  

The program is menu-based and includes 4 options.  
If the user enters a number that is not part of the menu, an error message is displayed.

## Features
- Add new tasks
- List existing tasks
- Delete tasks by number
- Error handling for invalid menu selections
- Simple and clean terminal interface

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open a terminal inside the project folder.
4. Run the following command:

## Future Improvements

- Save tasks to a file so they don’t disappear after closing the program
- Add a feature to edit tasks
- Add categories or priority levels
- Add a graphical interface (GUI) using Tkinter
